Render TAKPilot2-Autel's launcher icon at every density Android asks for.

The mark is concept A: a top-down quadcopter -- an X frame, four rotor rings -- with an aiming
reticle punched through the middle. Alaska flag palette, at the operator's request: PMS 281 navy
behind PMS 116 gold.

GEOMETRY IS DEFINED ON THE 108x108 ADAPTIVE-ICON GRID and scaled from there, so the vector
adaptive icon and these raster fallbacks are the same drawing rather than two that drifted apart.
Everything lives inside the 72dp safe circle (radius 36 from centre): on API 26+ the launcher
masks the outer ring away and applies parallax, so anything beyond that is not merely cropped on
some devices, it is cropped on all of them, differently.

Supersampled 8x and downsampled with LANCZOS. PIL has no antialiasing of its own, and at 48x48
an aliased rotor ring reads as a smudge.
