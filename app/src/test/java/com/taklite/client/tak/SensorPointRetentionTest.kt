/**
 * Pins the two things this application owes a receiver so the camera look-point (SPI) can
 * expire on its own: a SHORT stale window, and nothing that asks for the point to be kept.
 *
 * ⚠ **THE APPLICATION DOES NOT DELETE IT, AND THAT IS A DECISION** (operator, 2026-10-09). A
 * `t-x-d-d` delete, sent whenever the camera stopped having a look-point, was built and then
 * removed the same day. The controller does not tell the server to delete anything: how long a
 * point survives after it stops being refreshed is the receiving client's RETENTION POLICY. An
 * aircraft that reaches into every EUD on the net and removes a map item is a much larger
 * hammer than the problem.
 *
 * So these tests do not assert that the point goes away — they cannot, because that is not this
 * application's behaviour. They assert that nothing here STOPS it going away.
