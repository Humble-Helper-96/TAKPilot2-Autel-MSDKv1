/**
 * Drop-in replacement for android.util.Log across the TAK/Autel bridge code.
 * Always forwards to Log.* (adb logcat keeps working identically); additionally
 * appends to a rotating file under filesDir/logs/ while [enabled] is true, AND
 * mirrors the same lines into a user-accessible archive under Downloads/TAKPilot2
 * Logs — so a field session can be pulled off the controller without adb or the
 * in-app export flow. The private working copy (what the Debug screen's Clear/
 * Delete act on) is pruned by age (2h). The public archive is bounded by total
 * size instead — [PUBLIC_ARCHIVE_MAX_BYTES] — since size tracks actual log volume,
 * while wall-clock age doesn't (idle stretches produce no data, so a time window
 * is a poor proxy for "how much log data is this"). Oldest files are deleted
 * first whenever a new session file would push the folder over the cap.
 *
 * ## Lines are buffered, and the public file stays open (2026-09-10)
 *
 * Before this date each line went to the public archive on its own: one MediaStore stream
 * opened, one line written, the stream closed. On Android 10 each of those is a call to the
 * system media scanner. Measured in flight with logging on: the scanner used 120 % of a CPU
 * core, more than the application, and the screen stuttered. With logging off, the same
 * flight was smooth.
 *
 * Now a line goes to a buffer. The buffer goes to both files when it holds [FLUSH_BYTES], or
 * [FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS] after its first line, whichever is first. The public stream is opened
 * once per archive file and stays open until that file is full, logging is turned off, or a
 * crash is written. Thus the scanner sees one open and one close per file, not one per line.
 *
 * ⚠ THREE THINGS MUST NOT WAIT FOR THE TIMER. An error line (E) and a crash trace (FATAL)
 * flush at once — a trace that waits one second is a trace that the crash can take with it.
 * Turning logging off flushes and closes. The Debug screen's Clear and Delete flush first,
 * or they would clear the file and leave the last second of lines to reappear after it.
 * A process that the system KILLS (an OOM kill has no crash handler) can lose the last
 * [FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS] of lines. That is the accepted cost.
 *
 * Vendor-neutral (JDK + Android framework only) so it can live alongside
 * com.taklite.client.tak without breaking that package's no-SDK-imports rule.
