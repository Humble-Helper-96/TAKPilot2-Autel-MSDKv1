/**
 * Storage settings for the map tiles that osmdroid keeps.
 *
 * **The application caches each tile that the flight map draws.** This costs nothing more, because
 * the tile was fetched to be shown. Therefore a route flown one time with a connection is on the
 * controller for the next flight. It covers only the ground that the map has shown.
 *
 * ⚠ **There is no download of an area before a flight, and there is no control to select a tile
 * source.** The Map Display section did both. It was removed on 2026-08-04 (operator's decision).
 * **Therefore a first flight into new ground with no connection has no map.** Fly the area one
 * time with a connection, or keep a connection.
 *
 * osmdroid controls the size of the store itself: it removes the oldest tiles when the store
 * passes [MAX_BYTES]. No control in the application deletes the cache. The store cannot grow
 * without limit, but a person cannot reclaim the space early either.
