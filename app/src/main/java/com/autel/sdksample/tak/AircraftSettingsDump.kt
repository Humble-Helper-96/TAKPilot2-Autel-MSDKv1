/**
 * Reads every aircraft/controller setting this SDK exposes and writes them to the log, once per
 * connect.
 *
 * WHY. Most of these values are configured in Autel's own app, not here, and until now nothing
 * recorded what they actually were. That left several questions unanswerable from this side:
 * what the stick-mode enum corresponds to on the controller's own "Mode 1/2/3" screen, what the
 * normal gimbal-dial and yaw values are for this airframe, and what the low-battery thresholds
 * are set to — the last of which is directly relevant to the unexplained RTH behaviour (one
 * descent began near 14%, another near 24%).
 *
 * The intended workflow is exactly the operator's: set everything in Autel's app, close it
 * completely, then open this app. What lands in the log is the aircraft's real configuration.
 *
 * STRICTLY READ-ONLY. Every call here is a getter. Nothing in this file writes to the aircraft
 * or the controller, so it can run automatically at connect without changing how anything flies.
 *
 * ⚠ Autel's channels are SINGLE-CLIENT. If Autel's app is still running, these reads will time
 * out or return stale values and the dump will be misleading rather than empty — close it fully
 * before trusting what appears here.
