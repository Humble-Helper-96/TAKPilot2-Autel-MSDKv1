/**
 * A TextView with a BLACK OUTLINE around every glyph, for HUD readouts over live video
 * (operator, 2026-09-12).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The readouts sit over a picture whose brightness the pilot does not control. White text over
 * snow, wet asphalt or a white roof washes out. Two answers were used before this one:
 *
 *  1. A DROP SHADOW (`hudText`). It is a soft halo below and to one side, not a border. The
 *     specification says plainly that it "is not enough by itself".
 *  2. A TRANSLUCENT PANEL behind each block (`bg_hud_panel`). It works, but it covers live
 *     video that the pilot is flying from. Its opacity was walked down three times — 55 % to
 *     40 % to 20 % — each step trading legibility for picture, because the two fight.
 *
 * An outline ends that fight. A black border around each glyph is legible on ANY background,
 * light or dark, and it covers only the few pixels around the letters instead of a rectangle.
 * The panels go away and the pilot gets the video back.
 *
 * ## How it draws
 *
 * The text layout is drawn TWICE: first with a black stroked paint, then with the normal fill
 * on top. The [android.text.Layout] is drawn directly and NOT through `super.onDraw`, and the
 * paint's colour and style are set on the paint itself.
 *
 * ⚠ **NEVER USE `setTextColor` OR `setShadowLayer` INSIDE `onDraw` TO DO THIS.** Both call
 * `invalidate()`. On a view that is already drawing, that schedules another draw, which draws,
 * which schedules another — a permanent full-rate repaint of a view that sits over live video.
 * The obvious implementation of a two-pass outline has exactly that bug.
 *
 * Spans survive both passes, thus a [android.text.style.RelativeSizeSpan] on part of the text
 * is outlined at its own size — which is what the AGL readout needs.
 *
 * ## The width is PER-DEVICE, and it is SMALL
 *
 * `hud_text_outline_width` is a dimen with a `values-w820dp` override, for the same reason
 * `flight_readout_text_size` is: this controller draws the readouts at 18sp where a phone
 * draws them at 12sp.
 *
 * ⚠ **THE DIMEN IS THE STROKE WIDTH, AND IT IS NOT DOUBLED HERE.** The stroke is CENTRED on
 * the glyph edge, thus half of it falls INSIDE the letter and is covered by the fill pass. A
 * value that sounds modest eats the letter from within: at 18sp the text is 36px with stems
 * about 5px wide, so a 7px stroke leaves barely 1px of white and the readout turns to black
 * blobs. That was the first attempt (2026-09-12) and it was unreadable on the controller.
 *
 * Keep the stroke near **1/8th of the text size**: about 4px against 36px text here, 3px
 * against the 24px of the base bucket. Look at it on a real screen after any change — this is
 * one of those values that reads as fine in a mockup and fails on the device.

        // sets the paint's colour from its resolved text colour inside `super.onDraw`, which
        // this method never calls — so the paint's colour is not the text colour, and saving
        // and restoring it just carries the wrong value forward. Reading it here is what makes
        // the text white. Getting this wrong renders the whole readout in near-black and looks
        // like a stroke-width problem (2026-09-12).
