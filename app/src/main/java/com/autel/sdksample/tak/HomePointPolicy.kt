/**
 * Did the aircraft's home point really move to where the pilot asked?
 *
 * ⚠ **THIS IS THE READOUT WITH THE WORST CONSEQUENCE IF IT LIES.** The home point is where
 * Return to Home flies the aircraft. `setLocationAsHomePoint` reported success and this
 * application told the pilot "Home Point Updated" on that word alone — safety rule 4, on the
 * one control where being wrong sends the airframe to the wrong field.
 *
 * There is no need to ask the aircraft anything. It reports its own home point in the
 * fly-controller telemetry that already arrives at about 2 Hz — `homeEnable`, `homeLatitude`,
 * `homeLongitude`, read at [AutelTakBridge] and carried on the HUD snapshot, where the flight
 * screen has been drawing the home marker and the home distance from it all along. The truth
 * was already on the screen; nothing compared it with the request.
 *
 * ⚠ **THE BLIND SPOT IS REAL AND IT IS HARMLESS, WHICH IS WHY THE TOLERANCE CAN BE GENEROUS.**
 * This cannot tell "the home point moved to where I stand" from "the home point never moved"
 * when the pilot is standing within [HOME_POINT_TOLERANCE_M] of the old one. It does not need
 * to: in that case Return to Home brings the aircraft to the same patch of ground either way,
 * so the two outcomes the check confuses are the two outcomes that do not differ. The failure
 * worth catching is the home point staying at a takeoff site the pilot has since walked away
 * from, and that is tens or hundreds of metres, not three.
