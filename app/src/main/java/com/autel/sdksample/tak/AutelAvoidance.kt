/**
 * Obstacle-avoidance state, cached process-wide.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now this app was completely blind to avoidance: it never read the
 * state, never displayed it, and never set it. So avoidance was in whatever state something
 * else left it — Autel Explorer, or the aircraft's own default — and NOTHING on any screen
 * told the pilot which. A disabled avoidance system that looks identical to an enabled one is
 * the same class of problem as the low-battery RTH the app could not see: the aircraft behaves
 * differently and the pilot has no way to know.
 *
 * PRE-FLIGHT IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH, PUSHED AT CONNECT (operator, 2026-08-02).
 *
 * This deliberately REVERSED an earlier rule that said the app must never push a saved avoidance
 * state. That rule was protecting against a stale checkbox silently disabling a safety system —
 * a real hazard, but it left a worse one in place: Autel's own app can set avoidance to anything
 * it likes, and a pilot launching TAKPilot had no idea what they were about to fly with. Leaving
 * "whatever was there" is not neutral, it is unknown.
 *
 * So the settings are now enforced from Pre-Flight on every connect, AND shown on the Enter
 * Flight card before the pilot can reach the flight screen. Enforcement plus visibility beats
 * non-interference — the pilot can always see what was applied, which is what makes pushing
 * safe. The defaults are all ON, so an install that has never been configured errs toward
 * protection rather than away from it.
 *
 * Two independent feeds, both from the fly controller's visual interface:
 *  - [VisualSettingInfo]  — the SETTINGS (is avoidance on, is it on during RTH, etc.)
 *  - [AvoidanceRadarInfo] — LIVE obstacle distances, six faces, six sub-sectors each
