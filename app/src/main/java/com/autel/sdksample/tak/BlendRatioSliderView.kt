/**
 * How much THERMAL shows in the PIP window: a vertical slider beside the actions column.
 *
 * ⚠ **THE SAME CONTROL AS [EvSliderView], TURNED ON ITS SIDE, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.** Track,
 * ticks, thumb, and the black double-pass outline are identical — one weight of edge across the
 * whole HUD (specification §4.3). A second slider drawn to its own taste would read as a
 * different class of control.
 *
 * UP IS MORE THERMAL. The camera's pair is IR against Visible summing to 65535, and Explorer
 * shows it as a percentage; up the screen is up the percentage, which is the only mapping a
 * pilot who has used Explorer will predict.
 *
 * ⚠ **IT IS SHOWN ONLY IN PIP.** In VISIBLE there is no thermal layer and in full thermal there
 * is nothing to mix it with, so the control would move and change nothing — see
 * FlightActivity.renderBlendSlider.
