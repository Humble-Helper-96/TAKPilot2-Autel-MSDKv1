/**
 * The fixed zoom levels the rocker steps through, and the rule for moving between them.
 *
 * A pilot frames a subject at a few known magnifications, not at the values between them. The
 * rocker moved the zoom continuously until 2026-08-15 — 0.6x for each tick of held time, with
 * soft detents that parked at 2x, 4x and 8x — and the operator's judgement after flying it was
 * that the values between the levels were not wanted. One press moves one level. A held rocker
 * walks the levels and stops on whichever one it reaches.
 *
 * THE LEVELS ARE THE OPERATOR'S (2026-08-15). 12x was added to the list first proposed: 10x
 * straight to 16x is a 60% jump, far wider than any other step, and the long end would feel
 * like the control skips.
 *
 * NO ANDROID OR SDK IMPORTS, ON PURPOSE. This is the part with the arithmetic in it, thus the
 * part worth testing, and `FlightActivity` cannot be reached from a unit test. See
 * `ZoomLadderTest`.
