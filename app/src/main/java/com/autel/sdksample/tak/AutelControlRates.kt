/**
 * Controller feel: gimbal-wheel speed and yaw rate, plus the (read-only) stick mode.
 *
 * WHAT "PRECISION" IS. Both values live on the REMOTE CONTROLLER, not the aircraft:
 *   setGimbalDialAdjustSpeed(int)  — how fast the gimbal wheel drives the camera
 *   setYawCoefficient(float)       — how fast the stick yaws the aircraft
 * Precision slows both. It changes how the CONTROLS respond, not
 * how the aircraft flies — the flight-sensitivity family (pitch/roll/brake/ATTI) is a separate
 * thing and is deliberately not touched here.
 *
 * NORMAL AND PRECISION ARE EXPLICIT VALUES, set by the operator after reading the aircraft's
 * own numbers off a settings dump (2026-08-02). The airframe shipped with a gimbal dial of 100
 * and had been moved to 50 in Autel's app; neither was what the operator wanted, so the values
 * below were tuned by feel in flight rather than discovered. An earlier version LEARNED normal from whatever the
 * controller happened to report — which sounds safer but silently inherits whatever the last
 * app left behind, including a Precision value, and would ratchet the controls slower on every
 * toggle.
 *
 * Nothing here runs on connect. Same rule as obstacle avoidance: the app never changes how the
 * aircraft handles unless the pilot asks it to.

    // rounds of "make Precision yaw slower" (0.13, then 0.10) were silently clamped back up to
    // 0.2 and changed nothing, while the log reported "-> PRECISION" each time. Yaw felt fast
    // because the RATE had never been touched. Curve and rate are different questions: the curve
    // decides how twitchy the centre feels, the rate decides how fast full deflection yaws.

     * Applies the pilot's saved choices to the controller at connect.

     * ⚠ STICK MODE IS ONLY PUSHED IF THE PILOT HAS ACTUALLY CHOSEN ONE. An unset preference
     * leaves the controller alone, because a default that silently rewrote the stick mode would
     * swap throttle and pitch for anyone who never opened Pre-Flight. Once chosen, it IS pushed
     * every connect — which is the point, and why the Enter Flight card shows it before the
     * pilot can reach the flight screen.
     *
     * CONTROL RESPONSE IS DIFFERENT: IT IS ALWAYS PUSHED (operator, 2026-08-04). Launching
     * TAKPilot sets a clean slate — the Pre-Flight choice is applied to the airframe every
     * time, so whatever Autel Explorer or another pilot left behind is overwritten rather than
     * inherited. An unset preference means NORMAL, which is a real state to assert, not a reason
     * to leave the controller alone.
     *
     * (This is the opposite of the stick-mode rule above, deliberately. A wrong stick mode swaps
     * throttle and pitch and can only be discovered in the air, so the app refuses to guess one.
     * Control response only changes how fast the gimbal wheel and yaw respond — asserting a
     * known feel is safer than inheriting an unknown one.)
