 * file proves nothing: the url is the only part of the event that points at something on the
 * card. A done that DOES name a file has been right every time it has been checked.
 *
 * The evidence, re-measured on 2026-09-13 and cross-referenced with the card:
 *
 *  - 15 shutter presses gave 15 dones carrying a url, and all 15 files are on the card.
 *  - 12 further dones carried no url. Every one of them TRAILED a named done for the same
 *    shutter — the firmware's echo, not a capture of its own.
 *
 * ⚠ **AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS NOTE CLAIMED TWO PHOTOS WERE LOST ON 2026-09-12 (stills 0021
 * and 0024). THAT CLAIM IS WITHDRAWN** — `MAX_0024.JPG` is on the card, and 0021 was never a
 * photo number because that block numbers one press as three consecutive files. See CLAUDE.md
 * finding 2. **No capture has ever been observed to fail**, so this predicate is a guard
 * against a state that is possible rather than one that has been seen. Do not restore the lost
 * -photo story, and do not weaken the predicate on the grounds that nothing has failed yet:
 * telling a pilot a photo was saved when it was not is the outcome being prevented.
 *
 * A successful capture also emits a SECOND, url-less DONE right after the first. That is why
 * this asks "did THIS event name a file", and why the caller must not let the second event
 * overwrite the timestamp of the first — see [isSpuriousPhotoFailure].

/**
 * True when a PHOTO_TAKEN_DONE that named no file is the TRAILING ECHO of a capture that just
 * succeeded, rather than the report of a lost still.
 *
 * Both look identical on their own — a done, carrying nothing. The sequence tells them apart:
 *
 *  - A real capture emits a done WITH a url and then a second, url-less done. All 15 presses
 *    of the 2026-09-13 flight had this shape and all 15 files are on the card.
 *  - A lost still would emit the url-less done ALONE. That shape has not been observed — see
 *    the withdrawal note on [photoDoneNamesAFile] — thus this branch is a guard, not a repair.
 *
 * So a url-less done that follows a CONFIRMED one closely is the echo. It must not arm the
 * clock [isPhotoFailure] reads, or a firmware duplicate failure carrying no description would
 * be attributed to it and the pilot would be told a saved photo was lost — the 2026-09-12
 * fault with the sign reversed, which is no better.
 *
 * Reuses [SPURIOUS_PHOTO_FAIL_WINDOW_MS] rather than adding a fourth number: it is the same
 * question over the same measured gap of milliseconds, with the same two orders of magnitude
 * of margin.
