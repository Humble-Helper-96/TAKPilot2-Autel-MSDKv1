/**
 * Detects erratic gimbal pitch motion from the samples the bridge feeds it.
 *
 * **This class is fed. It does not subscribe.** The bridge's gimbal angle listener calls
 * [onSample] with each pitch value it already receives (standing rule 2, the
 * [FlightPathLogger] pattern). No SDK imports, no Android imports — the caller passes the
 * clock, so the JVM tests can step time.
 *
 * **The discriminator is amplitude PLUS reversal count, not rate.** On the 2026-08-13
 * incident flight the pitch swept the full range (-26° to +28.8°) at ~8°/s with continuous
 * reversals for more than 39 s before the pilot reacted. Normal flying on the same logs
 * shows deliberate dial sweeps up to ~10°/s — FASTER than the incident — but each sweep ends
 * in a hold, so a window never collects both large accumulated travel AND many direction
 * reversals. Erratic motion collects both.
 *
 * Thresholds are MEASURED, not guessed. The detector was replayed over the real pitch
 * series of 2026-08-13 — six minutes of deliberate searching (11:35:59–11:41:14) as the
 * negative case, the runaway (11:41:20 onward) as the positive:
 * - **45 s window, 100° travel, 4 reversals of ≥15°:** never fires across the whole
 *   normal-flight sample, and fires 30 s into the runaway — nine seconds before the
 *   pilot recognised it and pressed RTH.
 * - The first shipped guess (25 s) also never false-fired, but it only reached the
 *   threshold 53 s in, AFTER the pilot had already acted, which makes the warning
 *   pointless. Four reversals simply cannot land inside 25 s at the incident's ~7 s
 *   reversal period. This is why the window is wide: it is not sensitivity, it is the
 *   time four reversals need.
 * - Dropping to 3 reversals would fire at 20 s and still looked clean on this sample,
 *   but a down-up-down search scan is 3 reversals, so the margin against a real pilot
 *   sweep is gone. Four is kept deliberately.
 * - [minSwingDeg] = 15° is far above stabilisation jitter (sub-degree) and framing
 *   corrections, and below the incident's smallest qualifying legs — hover noise
 *   cannot count.
