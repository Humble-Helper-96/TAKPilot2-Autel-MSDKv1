/**
 * Where the camera draws the thermal window inside the visible frame in PIP, as fractions of
 * the frame. MEASURED on this camera (XL726, 2026-09-14 and 15), not derived: the FOV ratio
 * predicts 0.46 wide by 0.65 high and the camera draws 0.40 by 0.61, offset about 1.6 % of the
 * width to the LEFT and 4.7 % of the height UP — that offset is the thermal lens's boresight
 * against the visible lens's, and it is why the window is not centred on the crosshair.
 *
 * Used to put the maximise control on the window's top-right corner. A few per cent of error
 * puts the control a few pixels off a corner nobody measures; it does not affect the picture,
 * the wire or a marker. Zoom does not enter — the camera refuses zoom in PIP.
 *
 * No Android import, so [PipWindowGeometryTest] can pin the corner without a device.
