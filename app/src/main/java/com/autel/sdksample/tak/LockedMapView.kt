/**
 * osmdroid [MapView] with pilot navigation gestures disabled — the Autel equivalent of the DJI
 * flight screen's `uiSettings.setAllGesturesEnabled(false)` locked mini-map (operator's spec,
 * 2026-07-24): no pan, no zoom, no rotate. North stays up because the map orientation is never
 * changed, and zoom stays wherever [FlightActivity] pins it; the per-tick recenter on the
 * aircraft is the only thing that ever moves the camera.
 *
 * **Why this shape.** MapLibre/Mapbox gives DJI one `setAllGesturesEnabled` switch that still
 * leaves click listeners working. osmdroid has no equivalent, and two obvious shortcuts are both
 * wrong:
 *  - `setOnTouchListener { _, _ -> true }` locks the map but ALSO kills tapping an inbound TAK
 *    contact to hide it locally — [android.view.View.dispatchTouchEvent] consults the listener
 *    before `onTouchEvent`, so osmdroid's overlays never see the gesture at all.
 *  - Overriding `onScroll`/`onFling`/`onDoubleTap` doesn't compile: osmdroid's [MapView] is not
 *    itself the gesture listener (verified against osmdroid 6.1.14 — it holds a *private*
 *    `mGestureDetector` with an internal listener class), so there is nothing to override.
 *
 * So this consumes every touch WITHOUT calling `super.onTouchEvent` — which is what actually
 * suppresses pan/fling/double-tap-zoom, since all of those live in that private detector — and
 * runs its own detector purely to forward confirmed single taps to the overlay manager, keeping
 * marker taps alive. Pinch-zoom is off separately via `setMultiTouchControls(false)` at the call
 * site (that also nulls osmdroid's multi-touch controller, so `dispatchTouchEvent`'s multitouch
 * branch is skipped before it can reach us).
