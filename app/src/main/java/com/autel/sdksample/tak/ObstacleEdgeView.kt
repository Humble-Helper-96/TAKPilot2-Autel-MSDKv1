/**
 * Obstacle proximity drawn as a translucent gradient bleeding in from the edge nearest the
 * hazard, one per aircraft face.
 *
 * ⚠ **IT WAS AN ARC UNTIL 2026-09-13** — a stroked bow springing in from the edge with the
 * distance on a filled pill, copied from Autel Explorer after a wall strike because copying a
 * proven safety display beat inventing one. The operator replaced it in the GUI refresh with a
 * gradient: a wash that grows DEEPER into the screen and LESS transparent as the obstacle gets
 * closer.
 *
 * The reason it is better is the reason the arc was chosen in the first place, carried further.
 * An arc had to be READ — found at the edge, its thickness and colour judged. A gradient is
 * seen without being looked at, in the pilot's peripheral vision, while their eyes are on the
 * subject in the centre of the frame. Closing rate becomes a thing that grows toward you rather
 * than a line that thickens.
 *
 * ⚠ **IT COVERS LIVE VIDEO, WHICH IS WHY IT STAYS TRANSLUCENT AT ITS WORST.** This is the same
 * trade the HUD panels lost in §4.3 — but it resolves the other way here, and deliberately: a
 * panel covered the picture ALL THE TIME to make text legible, while this appears only when
 * something is within [WARN_CM] and the thing it covers is the direction of the hazard. It is
 * still capped below opaque, because a pilot steering away from an obstacle must be able to see
 * what they are steering INTO.
 *
 * FOUR EDGES PLUS AN EXPLICIT REAR READOUT. The aircraft reports six faces. Left, right, up and
 * down map to screen edges the way Explorer draws them — keeping that shared visual language
 * matters, because the operator switches between the two apps and must not have to re-learn what
 * an edge means. Front is omitted: an obstacle dead ahead is already IN the video.
 *
 * Rear was omitted too, at first, on the reasoning that a forward-looking view has no honest
 * place to put "behind you". The operator flew it and immediately asked where reverse was, which
 * exposed that as exactly backwards — behind the aircraft is the ONE direction the camera cannot
 * show, so it is where a readout earns the most. The fix is to label it, not to drop it: rear
 * gets its own captioned indicator above the bottom arc, visually distinct from the down arc so
 * the two can never be read as each other.
 *
 * UNITS: centimetres. Nothing in the SDK documents this — it was inferred from magnitudes and
 * then FIELD-VALIDATED on 2026-08-02, when the operator flew the display against real obstacles
 * and judged the distances accurate. That is agreement with reality at the ranges that matter,
 * not a bench calibration, so the readout is trustworthy for flying and should not be quoted to
 * the inch. Every distance still passes through [CM_PER_FOOT] alone, so if a future airframe or
 * firmware disagrees, exactly one number changes.
