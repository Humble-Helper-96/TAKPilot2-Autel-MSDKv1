/**
 * Watches the FPV picture arrive, so a stutter stops being a thing only the pilot saw.
 *
 * ⚠ **THREE STUTTERS ON 2026-09-13 AND THE APPLICATION COULD NOT SEE ONE OF THEM.** The
 * operator reported them at about 16:00, 16:03 and 16:04:45. The log had no error, no reconnect,
 * no stalled tick, flat CPU and GPU, and `sig=100% dsp=100%` on every sample either side of all
 * three. Three different pictures for three events, which is what it looks like when the cause
 * is below where the instrumentation reaches.
 *
 * It was reaching nowhere. `AutelCodecView` hands over a per-frame callback and
 * `FlightActivity` discarded it — `onRenderFrameTimestamp(ts) { /* not used */ }` — while a
 * stutter IS frames not arriving on time. The one signal that describes the fault was being
 * thrown away every frame.
 *
 * ## What it measures, and why it measures two things
 *
 * **Arrival gap** is this application's own clock between rendered frames. It answers "did the
 * picture freeze", which is the pilot's question.
 *
 * **The SDK's timestamp delta** is carried alongside, uninterpreted. If the two disagree the
 * cause is narrowed for free: frames arriving late in a burst while their timestamps stay
 * evenly spaced is a LINK or DECODE hiccup — the pictures exist and got here late. Timestamps
 * that jump with the arrivals means the source itself skipped, which is the aircraft or the
 * encoder, not the controller.
 *
 * ⚠ THE TIMESTAMP'S UNITS ARE NOT DOCUMENTED and are deliberately NOT assumed here. Nothing
 * branches on it; it is reported raw so the first flight tells us what it is. Guessing a unit
 * and dividing by it is how a diagnostic starts lying about the thing it was added to explain.
 *
 * ## It must not cost anything
 *
 * This runs on the SDK's render thread, once per frame, on the pipeline CLAUDE.md says must
 * never regress. The common path is a subtraction and two comparisons, and it allocates only
 * when it has something to say. A stall is rate-limited, and a periodic summary proves the
 * monitor is alive rather than merely silent — a diagnostic that says nothing is
 * indistinguishable from one that is not running.
