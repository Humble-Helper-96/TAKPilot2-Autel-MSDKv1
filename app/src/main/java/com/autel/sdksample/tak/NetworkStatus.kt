/**
 * One answer to "does this controller have a usable network?". The home screen's wifi line
 * and the Pre-Flight enrollment check share it, so the two can never disagree.
 *
 * THREE STATES, NOT TWO. The middle state is the important one. A controller can hold a wifi
 * association to a hotspot that has no upstream connection. That state caused the field
 * reports of "TAK enrollment failed" (v1.5.9, event 1): the wifi icon looked correct, but
 * the network went nowhere. Thus CONNECTED means the system CONFIRMED internet access
 * (NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED — Android's own reachability probe). An attached SSID alone is
 * not sufficient. Association without validation is its own state. Its text tells the pilot
 * that the network is the problem, not the TAK server.
 *
 * Polled, not listener-driven. The only consumers are Home's 1.5 s refresh loop and one
 * check when the pilot presses Enroll & Connect. A registered NetworkCallback would only be
 * one more object to release. A capability read is cheap.
