/**
 * The aircraft's exterior LEDs.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. This is a public-safety airframe. Flying lit at night tells anyone on the
 * ground exactly where the aircraft is, and crews have been shot at. Being able to go dark is an
 * operational requirement, not a convenience (operator, 2026-08-02).
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT COVER — read before telling a pilot the aircraft is dark.
 *
 * The SDK exposes FOUR separate light systems and we do not own all of them:
 *
 *  - **Pilot lamp** (`setLedPilotLamp`) — the arm / navigation LEDs. This is the bright one, it
 *    is what makes the aircraft visible, and it is fully controllable AND readable
 *    (`getLedPilotLamp`). This class controls it.
 *  - **Auxiliary LED** (`AuxiliaryLedState`) — **READ-ONLY**. It appears only as a field on
 *    `VisualSettingInfo`/`VisualWarningStatus`. There is no setter anywhere in the aar; searched
 *    the whole class surface, not just the flycontroller package. We cannot turn it off.
 *  - **Night light** (`doNightCtrl` → `MAV_CMD_NLIGHT_CTRL`) and **search light**
 *    (`doSlightCtrl` → `MAV_CMD_SLIGHT_CTRL`) — both sent as `AccessoryCmdRequest`, i.e. bolt-on
 *    accessories rather than built-in lights. Not driven here; if an accessory light is ever
 *    fitted to this airframe, it must be added or the pilot will believe they are dark and not be.
 *
 * So: this darkens the navigation LEDs. It is NOT a verified "every exterior light is off".
 * Anything shown to a pilot must say what was actually confirmed.
 *
 * ⚠ REGULATORY. FAA 14 CFR 107.29 requires anti-collision lighting visible for 3 statute miles
 * for night operation. Operating dark is the operator's decision under their own authority or
 * waiver. The app provides the control; it does not judge the legality.
